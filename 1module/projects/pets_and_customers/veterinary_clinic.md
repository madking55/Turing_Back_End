## Iteration 3

You have been contracted to build a software application for a veterinary clinic. This clinic has many veterinarians and would like to be able to track data on each one of them. Specifically, they would like you to implement the following features:

* Each Veterinarian has a name, as well as a way to read that data.
* Each Veterinarian has multiple customers, and each of those customers can have multiple pets.
* A Veterinarian can list all pets under their care; sorted by age (oldest to youngest)
* A Veterinarian can count the number of pets of a given customer.

Build upon your code from the first two iterations to complete this task.
