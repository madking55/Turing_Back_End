## User Stories

**Overview**
 
We are creating an application to track the maintenance of rides at amusement parks. We have amusement parks, which have many rides, rides can have many mechanics working on it, and mechanics can work on multiple rides.
 
Amusement Parks have a name and admission price
Mechanics have a name and years of experience
Rides have a name and thrill rating (1-10)
 
You will need to create all the migrations. You do not need to do model testing for validations, just make sure you test any relationships and model methods that you create.
Read each story carefully.

Story 1
As a user,
When I visit a mechanics index page
I see a header saying “All Mechanics”
And I see a list of all mechanic’s names and their years of experience
Ex:
             All Mechanics
   Sam Mills - 10 years of experience
   Kara Smith - 11 years of experience
```

I’m taken back to that mechanics show page
And I see the name of that newly added ride on this mechanics show page
